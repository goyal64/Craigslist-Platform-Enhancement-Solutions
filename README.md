# Craigslist-Platform-Enhancement-Solutions
Developed Python scripts to scrape data &amp; provided a lean product search system for Craigslist implementing deep learning models &amp; NLP; also implemented classification models to identify misclassified advertisements.

We aimed to maximize the opportunity Craigslist has in the form of better content curation to improve users' experience. Based on our analysis, we prioritized four critical problems:
1. Expired event posts
2. Old inactive posts
3. The outdated product search system
4. Misclassified advertisement.

We propose solutions for each of these issues that can be implemented with both dynamic and static datasets.
For the first two issues, we developed an algorithm that can identify listings that are expired or irrelevant. Furthermore, the criteria specifications can be specified by the Craigslist program/category managers, allowing them to make better-informed decisions.

To overcome the outdated product search system, we developed a lean product search system that would allow buyers to have a smoother experience in navigating the website pages. This should be effective in controlling the bounce rates and improve user traffic and engagement.

Finally, for addressing the “misclassified advertisements,” we have developed a machine learning model that learns to sort listings and identify whether a listing is placed under the correct category or not.
